        <p class="pageTitle"><br />Effectiveness of tutoring</p>
        <p align="justify">Tutoring, whether provided as supplemental or remedial instruction for   low-achieving students or for enrichment or competitive advantage to high-achieving students, is generally perceived as a valuable investment   benefitting students; however, the quality of tutoring services is notoriously   difficult to assess. Tutors differ with respect to their qualifications,   training, age, and even motivations for tutoring. There is no guarantee that   private, independent tutors can or will offer quality tutoring, as the most   common characteristic of tutors is that they are older than the students they   are tutoring. Tutoring companies, although they likely employ qualified and   trained tutors, differ in the quality of instruction they provide and their   orientation toward learning and education. A common criticism of many tutoring companies is that they   teach rote learning rather than comprehension of principles.</p>
        <p align="justify">Nonetheless, there is evidence that tutoring can be effective. For example,   findings from a meta-analysis of studies on the effectiveness of tutoring showed   that tutored students showed higher academic achievement than non-tutored   (control) students, as measured on examinations. In another study of students at risk for academic failure,   peer tutoring (in combination with parental involvement) was found to be   effective in helping students make gains in classroom-based and standardized   mathematical achievement tests. The tutored students obtained higher scores than   the (control group) students who were asked to practice their math lessons on   their own.</p>
        <p align="justify">Although the demand for tutors is typically in the area of mathematics—and   some studies have shown that larger gains result from tutoring in mathematics   than in other subjects such as reading —tutoring can also be an effective supplemental   instructional strategy for reading. A recent study revealed large improvements   in sight-word acquisition, and smaller gains in reading fluency and   comprehension, among students identified as being at risk for reading failure   and who participated in a peer tutoring intervention.</p>
        <p align="justify">In addition to improving academic outcomes, some evidence suggests that   tutoring positively affects students' self-confidence. Tutored students develop positive   attitudes toward the subject in which they are tutored,  particularly in a subject like mathematics   where negative attitudes have been observed to be common. One-on-one tutoring,   in particular, can help students overcome the anxiety often encountered in   classrooms where rewards are based on performance. By contrast, the reward for   tutored students is usually the learning process itself, and success is based on   effort and practice. Similar   gains in self-confidence are made by at-risk students, who also show improvements in classroom   behaviour and self-control.</p>
