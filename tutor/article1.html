        Tutoring teens</p> 
        <p><strong>Tutoring options give immigrant teens an advantage
          </strong><br />
        </p>
        <p class="style1">        Sophia Kim        </p>
        <p align="justify">For Darang Lee, a 17-year-old immigrant from Korea, her evenings after school   are rather busy with the usual teenage activities like homework, socializing   with friends and stressing about the future. <br />
              <br />
            But like most immigrant   teens, Lee has the added burden of after-school tutoring classes. <br />
            <br />
            As a   high school student in her final year, the pressures of achieving academic   success are paramount. And as many immigrant teens from traditional immigrant   parents would confess, the one sure way to a good life, it appears, is by doing   well at school. <br />
            <br />
            It’s no surprise then, that Lee is now spending her   afternoons and evenings having her education supplemented by a private   tutor.<br />
            <br />
            The range of tutoring subjects varies for each student. While some   students like Lee — who has been in Canada for more than half of her life — are   content with a few tutoring classes a week in math and French, other students,   especially more recent immigrant youths, are benefitting from daily tutoring in   social studies, English and sciences. <br />
            <br />
            Not that all students are tutored   in academic courses.<br />
            <br />
            Students aspiring to be artists — like Min Lee, an   18-year-old immigrant also from Korea — spend most of their evenings in an art   studio where a private tutor will guide them in their portfolio   preparation.<br />
            <br />
            Despite the differences in the subjects, the effect of   tutoring seems to be similar for all students.<br />
            <br />
            “I find tutoring is really   helpful,” says Darang Lee, “because I can get ahead and get a better   mark.”<br />
            <br />
            Unfortunately, like all good plans, there is one potential   drawback of tutoring — boredom in school.<br />
            <br />
            “If I’m too ahead with   tutoring, I get bored in school,” says Darang Lee.<br />
            <br />
            However, it seems as   though the benefits of tutoring far outweigh the potential disadvantage as even   non-immigrant students are picking up tutoring classes after school. <br />
            <br />
            “Even my non-immigrant friends have tutors for some subject,” explains   Darang Lee.<br />
            <br />
            Inah Kim, a middle-school math teacher in Korea who has been   tutoring math in Canada for more than a decade, explains the benefits of   tutoring have a more significant side effect. <br />
            <br />
            “Many immigrant students   have a hard time obtaining good grades [in topics such as] English or social   studies because of the language barrier,” explains Kim.<br />
            <br />
            “So by having a   private tutor teach them the material before the school teacher does, the   students are given a better chance of getting an A. This helps them go to   university.”<br />
            <br />
          So with no lack of private tutors and tutoring schools in   Canada, tutoring might just be the advantage your teenager needs. </p>
